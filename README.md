# CollabAR

We plan on shifting the modern work space away from offices to the people and promote collaboration through the use of AR.

This iOS app creates a virtual desktop in augmented reality that can be extended to other users to create a shared workspace.
The virtual desktop includes sticky notes, images, videos, web shortcuts and timers that can be placed and shared in AR.

Our team from the University of Sydney created this project.
